Surveying can be determined as a means of making relatively large-scale,
accurate measurements of the Earth’s surfaces. It includes the determination
of the measurement data, the reduction and interpretation of the data to usable
form, and, conversely, the establishment of relative position and size according
to given measurement requirements. Thus, surveying has two similar but
opposite functions: 1) the determination of existing relative horizontal and
vertical position, such as that used for the process of mapping, and 2) the
establishment of marks to control construction or to indicate land boundaries.
Surveying has been an essential element in the development of the human
environment for so many centuries that its importance is often forgotten. It is
an imperative requirement in the planning and execution of nearly every form
of construction. Surveying was essential at the dawn of history, and some of
the most significant scientific discoveries could never have been implemented
were it not for the contribution of surveying. Its principal modern uses are in the
fields of transportation, building, apportionment of land, and communications.
It is quite probable that surveying had its origin in ancient Egypt. The
Great Pyramid of Khufu at Giza was built about 2700 BC, 755 feet (230

metres) long and 481 feet (147 metres) high. Its nearly perfect squareness and
north-south orientation affirm the ancient Egyptians’ command of surveying.
Evidence of some form of boundary surveying as early as 1400 BC has
been found in the fertile valleys and plains of the Tigris, Euphrates, and Nile
rivers. Clay tablets of the Sumerians show records of land measurement and
plans of cities and nearby agricultural areas. Boundary stones marking land plots
have been preserved. There is a representation of land measurement on the wall
of a tomb at Thebes (1400 BC) showing head and rear chainmen measuring a
grainfield with what appears to be a rope with knots or marks at uniform intervals.
There is some evidence that in addition to a marked cord, wooden rods
were used by the Egyptians for distance measurement. There is no record of
any angle-measuring instruments, but there was a level consisting of a vertical
wooden A-frame with a plumb bob supported at the peak of the A so that its
cord hung past an indicator, or index, on the horizontal bar. The index could
be properly placed by standing the device on two supports at approximately
the same elevation, marking the position of the cord, reversing the A, and
making a similar mark. Halfway between the two marks would be the correct
place for the index. Thus, with their simple devices, the ancient Egyptians
were able to measure land areas, replace property corners lost when the Nile
covered the markers with silt during floods, and build the huge pyramids to
exact dimensions.
The Greeks used a form of log line for recording the distances run from
point to point along the coast while making their slow voyages from the Indus
to the Persian Gulf about 325 BC. The magnetic compass was brought to the
West by Arab traders in the 12th century AD. The astrolabe was introduced by
the Greeks in the 2nd century BC. An instrument for measuring the altitudes of
stars, or their angle of elevation above the horizon, took the form of a graduated
arc suspended from a hand-held cord. A pivoted pointer that moved over the
graduations was pointed at the star. The instrument was not used for nautical
surveying for several centuries, remaining a scientific aid only.
The Greeks also possibly originated the use of the groma, a device used
to establish right angles, but Roman surveyors made it a standard tool. It was
made of a horizontal wooden cross pivoted at the middle and supported from
above. From the end of each of the four arms hung a plumb bob. By sighting
along each pair of plumb bob cords in turn, the right angle could be established.
The device could be adjusted to a precise right angle by observing the same
angle after turning the device approximately 90°. By shifting one of the cords
to take up half the error, a perfect angle would result.
About 15 BC the Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius mounted a large
wheel of known circumference in a small frame, in much the same fashion as
the wheel is mounted on a wheelbarrow; when it was pushed along the ground

by hand it automatically dropped a pebble into a container at each revolution;
giving a measure of the distance traveled. It was, in effect, the first odometer.
The water level consisted of either a trough or a tube turned upward at
the ends and filled with water. At each end there was a sight made of crossed
horizontal and vertical slits. When these were lined up just above the water
level, the sights determined a level line accurate enough to establish the grades
of the roman aqueducts. In laying out their great road system, the Romans are
said to have used the plane table. It consists of a drawing board mounted on
a tripod or other stable support and of a straightedge – usually with sights for
accurate aim (the alidade) to the objects to be mapped – along which lines
are drawn. It was the first device capable of recording or establishing angles.
Later adaptations of the plane table had magnetic compasses attached.
Plane tables were in use in Europe in the 16th century, and the principle
of graphic triangulation and intersection was practiced by surveyors. In 1615
Willebrord Snell, a Dutch mathematician, measured an arc of meridian by
instrumental triangulation. In 1620 the English mathematician Edmund Gunter
developed a surveying chain, which was superseded only by the steel tape
beginning in the late 19th century.
The study of astronomy resulted in the development of angle-reading
devices that were based on arcs of large radii, making such instruments too
large for field use. With the publication of logarithmic tables in 1620, portable
angle-measuring instruments came into use. They were called topographic
instruments, or theodolites. They included pivoted arms for sighting and
could be used for measuring both horizontal and vertical angles. Magnetic
compasses may have been included on some.
The vernier, an auxiliary scale permitting more accurate readings (1631),
the micrometer microscope (1638), telescopic sights (1669), and spirit levels
(about 1700) were all incorporated in theodolites by about 1720. Stadia hairs
were first applied by James Watt in 1771. The development of the circledividing engine about 1775, a device for dividing a circle into degrees with
great accuracy, brought one of the greatest advances in surveying methods,
as it enabled angle measurements to be made with portable instruments far
more accurately than had previously been possible.
Modern surveying can be said to have begun by the late 18th century.
One of the most notable early feats of surveyors was the measurement in the
1790s of the meridian from Barcelona, Spain, to Dunkirk, France, by two
French engineers, Jean Delambre and Pierre Méchain, to establish the basic
unit for the metric system of measurement.
Many improvements and refinements have been incorporated in all the
basic surveying instruments. These have resulted in increased accuracy and
speed of operations and opened up possibilities for improved methods in the
field. In addition to modification of existing instruments, two revolutionary
mapping and surveying changes were introduced: photogrammetry, or mapping
from aerial photographs (about 1920), and electronic distance measurement,
including the adoption of the laser for this purpose as well as for alignment
(in the 1960s). Important technological developments starting in the late 20th
century include the use of satellites as reference points for geodetic surveys
and electronic computers to speed the processing and recording of survey data.

The scientific objective of geodesy is to determine the size and shape of
the Earth. The practical role of geodesy is to provide a network of accurately
surveyed points on the Earth’s surface, the vertical elevations and geographic
positions of which are precisely known and, in turn, may be incorporated in
maps. When two geographic coordinates of a control point on the Earth’s
surface, its latitude and longitude, are known as well as its elevation above
sea level, the location of that point is known with accuracy within the limits
of error involved in the surveying processes. In mapping large areas, such as
a whole state or country, the irregularities in the curvature of the Earth must
be considered. A network of precisely surveyed control points provides a
skeleton to which other surveys may be tied to provide progressively finer
networks of more closely space points. The resulting networks of points have
many uses, including anchor points or bench marks for surveys of highways
and other civil features. A major use of control points is to provide reference
points to which the contour lines and other features of topographic maps are
tied. Most topographic maps are made using photogrammetric techniques
and aerial photographs.
The Earth’s figure is that of a surface called the geoid, which over the
Earth is the average sea level at each location; under the continents the geoid
is an imaginary continuation of sea level. The geoid is not a uniform spheroid,
however, because of the existence of irregularities in the attraction of gravity
from place to place on the Earth’s surface. These irregularities of the geoid
would bring about serious errors in the surveyed location of control points
if astronomical methods, which involve use of the local horizon, were used
solely in determining locations. Because of these irregularities, the reference
surface used in geodesy is that of a regular mathematical surface, an ellipsoid
of revolution that fits the geoid as closely as possible. This reference ellipsoid
is below the geoid in some places and above it in the others. Over the oceans,
mean sea level defines the geoid surface, but over the land areas the geoid is
an imaginary sea-level surface.
Today perturbations in the motions of artificial satellites are used to
define the global geoid and gravity pattern with a high degree of accuracy.
Geodetic satellites are positioned at a height of 700-800 kilometers above
the Earth. Simultaneous range observations from several laser stations fix the
position of a satellite, and radar altimeters measure directly its height over
the oceans. Results show that the geoid is irregular; in places its surface is
up to 100 metres higher than the ideal reference ellipsoid and elsewhere it is
as much as 100 metres below it. The most likely explanation for this height
variation is that the gravity (and density) anomalies are related to mantle
convection and temperature differences at depth. An important observation
that confirms this interpretation is that there is a close correlation between the
gravity anomalies and the surface expression of the Earth’s plate boundaries.
This also strengthens the idea that the ultimate driving force of tectonic plate
is a large-scale circulation of the mantle.
A similar satellite ranging technique is also used to determine the drift
rates of continents. Repeated measurements of laser light travel times between
ground stations and satellites permit the relative movement of different control
blocks to be calculated.

A system of triangles usually affords superior horizontal control. All of the
angles and at least one side (the base) of the triangulation system are measured.
Though several arrangements can be used, one of the best is the quadrangle or
a chain of quadrangles. Each quadrangle, with its four sides and two diagonals,
provides eight angles that are measured. To be geometrically consistent, the
angles must satisfy three so-called angle equations and one side equation. That
is to say the three angles of each triangle, which add to 180°, must be of such
sizes that computation through any set of adjacent triangles with the quadrangles
will give the same values for any side. Ideally, the quadrangles should be

parallelograms. If the system is connected with previously determined stations,
the new system must fit the established measurements.
When the survey encompasses an area large enough for the Earth’s
curvature to be a factor, an imaginary mathematical representation of the
Earth must be employed as a reference surface. A level surface at mean sea
level is considered to represent the Earth’s size and shape, and this is called
the geoid. Because of gravity anomalies, the geoid is irregular; however, it is
very nearly the surface generated by an ellipse rotating on its minor axis – i.e.
an ellipsoid slightly flattened at the ends, or oblate. Such a figure is called a
spheroid. Several have been computed by various authorities; the one usually
used as a reference surface by English-speaking nations is (Alexander Ross)
Clarke’s Spheroid of 1866. This oblate spheroid has a polar diameter about
27 miles (43 kilometres) less than its diameter at the Equator.
Because the directions of gravity converge toward the geoid, a length of
the Earth’s surface measured above the geoid must be reduced to its sea-level
equivalent – i.e. to that of the geoid. These lengths are assumed to be the
distances, measured on the spheroid, between the extended lines of gravity
down to the spheroid from the ends of the measured lengths on the actual
surface of the Earth. The positions of the survey stations on the Earth’s surface
are given in spherical coordinates.
Bench marks, or marked points on the Earth’s surface, connected by
precise leveling constitute the vertical controls of surveying. The elevations
of bench marks are given in terms of their heights above a selected level
surface called a datum. In large-level surveys the usual datum is the geoid. The
elevation taken as zero for the reference datum is the height of mean sea level
determined by a series of observations at various points along the seashore
taken continuously for a period of 19 years or more. Because mean sea level
is not quite the same as the geoid, probably because of ocean currents, in
adjusting the level grid for the United States and Canada all heights determined
for mean sea level have been held at zero elevation.
Because the level surfaces, determined by leveling, are distorted slightly in
the area toward the Earth’s poles (because of the reduction in centrifugal force
and the increase in the force of gravity at higher latitudes), the distances between
the surfaces and the geoid do not exactly represent the surface’s heights from
the geoid. To correct these distortions, orthometric corrections must be applied
to long lines of levels at high altitudes that have a north-south trend.
Trigonometric leveling often is necessary where accurate elevations are
not available or when the elevations of inaccessible points must be determined.
From two points of known position and elevation, the horizontal position of
the unknown point is found by triangulation, and the vertical angles from

the known points are measured. The differences in elevation from each of
the known points to the unknown point can be computed trigonometrically.
The National Ocean Service in recent years has hoped to increase the
density of horizontal control to the extent that no location in the United States
will be farther than 50 miles (80 kilometres) from a primary point, and advances
anticipated in analytic phototriangulation suggest that the envisioned density
of control may soon suffice insofar as topographic mapping is concerned.
Existing densities of control in Britain and much of western Europe are already
adequate for mapping and cadastral surveys. 

Most surveying frameworks are erected by measuring the angles and the
lengths of the sides of a chain of triangles connecting the points fixed by global
positioning. The locations of ground features are then determined in relation
to these triangles by less accurate and therefore cheaper methods. Establishing
the framework ensures that detail surveys conducted at different times or by
different surveyors fit together without overlaps or gaps.
For centuries the corners of these triangles have been located on hilltops,
each visible from at least two others, at which the angles between the lines
joining them are measured; this process is called triangulation. The lengths
of one or two of these lines, called bases, are measured with great care; all
the other lengths are derived by trigonometric calculations from them and
the angles. Rapid checks on the accuracy are provided by measuring all three
angles of each triangle, which must add up to 180 degrees.
In small flat areas, working at large scales, it may be easier to measure the
lengths of all the sides, using a tape or a chain, rather than the angles between
them; this procedure, called trilateration, was impractical over large or hilly
areas until the invention of electromagnetic distance measurement (EDM) in
the mid-20th century. This procedure has made it possible to measure distances
as accurately and easily as angles, by electronically timing the passage of
radiation over the distance to be measured; microwaves, which penetrate
atmospheric haze, are used for long distances and light or infrared radiation for
short ones. In the devices used for EDM, the radiation is either light (generated
by a laser or an electric lamp) or an ultrahigh-frequency radio beam. The light
beam requires a clear line of sight; the radio beam can penetrate fog, haze,
heavy rain, dust, sandstorms, and some foliage. Both types have a transmitterreceiver at one survey station. At the remote station the light type contains
a set of corner mirrors; the high-frequency type incorporates a retransmitter
(requiring an operator) identical to the transmitter-receiver at the original
station. A corner mirror has the shape of the inside of a corner of a cube; it
returns light toward the source from whatever angle it is received, within
reasonable limits. A retransmitter must be aimed at the transmitter-receiver.
In both types of instrument, the distance is determined by the length of
time it takes the radio or light beam to travel to the target and back. The elapsed
time is determined by the shift in phase of a modulating signal superimposed
on the carrier beam. Electronic circuitry detects this phase shift and converts
it to units of time; the use of more than one modulating frequency eliminates
ambiguities that could arise if only a single frequency had been employed.
EDM has greatly simplified an alternative technique, called traversing, for
establishing a framework. In traversing, the surveyor measures a succession
of distances and the angles between them, usually along a traveled route or a
stream. Before EDM was available, traversing was used only in flat or forested
areas where triangulation was impossible. Measuring all the distances by tape
or chain was tedious and slow, particularly if great accuracy was required, and
no check was obtainable until the traverse closed, either on itself or between
two points already fixed by triangulation or by astronomical observations.
In both triangulation and traversing, the slope of each measured line must
be allowed for so that the map can be reduced to the horizontal and referred to
sea level. A measuring tape may be stretched along the ground or suspended
between tripods; in precise work corrections must be applied for the sag, for
tension, and for temperature if these differ from the values at which the tape
was standardized. In work of the highest order, known as geodetic, the errors
must be kept to one millimetre in a kilometre, that is, one part in 1,000,000.

Though for sketch maps the compass or graphic techniques are acceptable
for measuring angles, only the theodolite can assure the accuracy required
in the framework needed for precise mapping. The theodolite consists of a
telescope pivoted around horizontal and vertical axes so that it can measure both
horizontal and vertical angles. These angles are read from circles graduated in
degrees and smaller intervals of 10 or 20 minutes. The exact position of the
index mark (showing the direction of the line of sight) between two of these
graduations is measured on both sides of the circle with the aid of a vernier
or a micrometer. The accuracy in modern first-order or geodetic instruments,
with five-inch glass circles, is approximately one second of arc. With such
an instrument a sideways movement of the target of one centimetre can be
detected at a distance of two kilometres. By repeating the measurement as
many as 16 times and averaging the results, horizontal angles can be measured
more closely; in geodetic surveying, measurements of all three angles of a
triangle are expected to give a sum of 180 degrees within one second of arc.
In the most precise long-distance work, signaling lamps or heliographs
reflecting the Sun are used as targets for the theodolite. For less demanding
work and work over shorter distances, smaller theodolites with simpler reading
systems can be used; targets are commonly striped poles or ranging rods held
vertical by an assistant.
An extensive set of these measurements establishes a network of points
both on the map, where their positions are plotted by their coordinates, and
on the ground, where they are marked by pillars, concrete ground marks,
bolts let into the pavement, or wooden pegs of varying degrees of cost and
permanence, depending on the importance and accuracy of the framework
and the maps to be based on it. Once this framework has been established, the
surveyor proceeds to the detail mapping, starting from these ground marks and
knowing that their accuracy ensures that the data obtained will fit precisely
with similar details obtained elsewhere in the framework.

The actual depiction of the features to be shown on the map can be
performed either on the ground or, since the invention of photography, aviation,
and rocketry, by interpretation of aerial photographs and satellite images. On
the ground the framework is dissected into even smaller areas as the surveyor
moves from one point to another, fixing further points on the features from
each position by combinations of angle and distance measurement and finally
sketching the features between them freehand. In complicated terrain this
operation can be slow and inaccurate, as can be seen by comparing maps
made on the ground with these made subsequently from aerial photographs.
Ground survey still has to be used, however, for some purposes; for
example, in areas where aerial photographs are hard to get; under the canopy of
a forest, where the shape of the ground – not that of the treetops – is required;
in very large scale work or close contouring; or if the features to be mapped are
not easily identifiable on the aerial photographs, as is the case with property
boundaries or zones of transition between different types of soil or vegetation.
One of two fundamental differences between ground and air survey is that,
as already mentioned, the ground survey interpolates, or sketches, between
fixed points, while air survey, using semiautomatic instruments, can trace
the features continuously, once the positions of the photographs are known.
One effect of this is to show features in uniform detail rather than along short
stretches between the points fixed in a ground survey.
The second difference is that in ground survey different techniques and
accuracies may be adopted for the horizontal and vertical measurements,
the latter usually being more precise. Accurate determinations of heights
are required for engineering and planning maps, for example, for railway
gradients or particularly for irrigation or drainage networks, since water in
open channels does not run uphill.
The methods used for fixing locations within the horizontal detail
framework are similar to, but less accurate than, those used for the primary
framework. Angles may be measured with a hand-held prismatic compass or
graphically with a plane table, or they may be estimated as right angles in the
case of points that are offset by short distances from straight lines between
points already fixed. Detail points may be located by their distances from two
fixed points or by distance and bearing from only one.
The surveyor may record measurements made in the field and plot them
there on a sketch board or in the office afterward, but if the country is open
and hilly, or even mountainous, the plane table offers the best way of recording
the data. A disadvantage of plane-table work is that it cannot be checked in
the office, and so it requires greater intelligence and integrity of the surveyor.
The plane table reached its most efficient form of use in the Survey of India,
begun in 1800, in which large areas were mapped with it by dedicated Indian
surveyors. It consists of a flat board that is mounted on a tripod so that it can
be fixed or rotated around a vertical axis. It is set up over a framework point or
one end of a measured baseline with its surface (which is covered with paper or
other drawing medium) horizontal. It is turned until the line joining its location
with another framework point or the other end of the baseline is parallel to the
same line as drawn on the paper. This alignment is performed with the aid of
an alidade, or sight rule, a straightedge fitted with simple sights. The alidade
is then directed toward points on features that are to be fixed, and pencil rays
are drawn along the sight rule toward them. The procedure is repeated at the
other framework point or the other end of the baseline; the points where the
rays intersect on the table will be the map positions of the features.
In surveying for engineering projects, more sophisticated instruments are
employed to maximize accuracy. For example, distances may be measured by
EDM or by tachymetry, a geometric technique in which the vertical distance
on a graduated vertical staff, seen between two stadia hairs in the theodolite
eyepiece, is a measure of the horizontal distance between the theodolite and
the staff – usually 100 times the difference between the two readings. This
method requires at least one assistant to move the staff from place to place.
Modern surveying instruments combine a theodolite, EDM equipment, and a
computer that records all the observations and calculates the height differences
obtained by measuring vertical angles.

Aviation and photography have revolutionized detailed mapping of
features visible from the air. An aerial photograph, however, is not a map.
In the case of the House of Parliament and Westminster Bridge, London,
for example, the tops of the towers would coincide with the corners of the
foundations when mapped. In an aerial photograph, however, they would not,
being displaced radially from the centre. An important property of vertical
aerial photographs is that angles are correctly represented at their centres, but
only there. Similar distortions are present in photographs of hilly ground. This
problem may be dealt with in two principal ways, depending on the relative
scales of the map and the photographs and on whether contours are required
on the map. The older method, adequate for planimetric maps at scales smaller
than the photographs, was used extensively during and after World War II to
map large areas of desert and thinly populated country; mountainous area
could be sketched in, but the relief was not accurately shown.
As in ground survey, a framework of identified points is necessary before
detailed mapping can be carried out from the air. The photographs are ordinarily
taken by a vertically aligned camera in a series of strips in which each picture
overlaps about 60 percent of the preceding one; adjacent strips overlap only
slightly. The overlaps make it possible to assemble a low-order framework or
control system based on small, recognizable features that appear in more than one
photograph. In the simplest form of this procedure each photograph is replaced
by a transparent template on which rays are drawn (or slots are cut) from the
centre of the picture to the selected features. The angles between these rays or
slots are correct, and slotted templates can be fitted together by inserting studs,
which represent the features, into the appropriate slots and sliding the templates
so that each stud engages the slots in all the pictures showing the corresponding
feature. This operation ensures that the centres of the pictures and the selected
features are in the correct relationship. The array of overlapping photographs
can be expanded or contracted by sliding them about on the work surface as long
as the studs remain engaged in the slots, so the assemblage can be positioned,
oriented, and scaled by fitting it to at least two – preferably several –groundcontrol points identified on different photographs.
This technique may be extended by using two additional cameras, one
on each side, aimed at right angles to the line of flight and 30 degrees below
the horizontal. The photographs taken by the side cameras overlap those
taken by the vertical one and also include the horizon; the effect is to widen
the strip of ground covered and thus to reduce the amount of flying required.
Points in the backgrounds of the oblique photographs can be incorporated
in the overlapping array as before to tie the adjacent flight paths together.
Photography from high-flying jet aircraft and satellites has rendered this
technique obsolete, but before those advances took place it greatly facilitated
the mapping of underdeveloped areas.
For the production of maps with accurate contours at scales five or six
times that of the photographs, a more sophisticated approach is necessary. The
ground-survey effort must be expanded to provide the heights as well as the
positions of all the features employed to establish the framework.
In this technique the details within each segment of the map are based not
on individual photographs but on the overlap between two successive ones
in the same strip, proceeding from the positions and heights of features in the
corners of each area. A three-dimensional model can be created by viewing
each pair of consecutive photographs in a stereoscope; by manipulation of a
specially designed plotting instrument, the overlapping area can be correctly
positioned, scaled, and oriented, and elevations of points within it can be
derived from those of the four corner points. These photogrammetric plotting
instruments can take several forms. In projection instruments the photographs
are projected onto a table in different colours so that, through spectacles with
lenses of complementary colours, each eye sees only one image, and the
operator visualizes a three-dimensional model of the ground. A table or platen,
with a lighted spot in the middle, can be moved around the model and raised or
lowered so that the spot appears to touch the ground while the operator scans
any feature, even if it is located on a steep hillside. A pencil directly beneath
the spot then plots the exact shape and position of the feature on the map. For
contouring the platen is fixed at the selected height (at a scale adjusted to that
of the model), and the spot is permitted to touch the model surface wherever
it will; the pencil then draws the contour.
With more complex mechanical devices, rays of the light reaching the
aircraft taking the two photographs are represented by rods meeting at a point
that represents the position of the feature of the model being viewed. With
a complicated system of prisms and lenses the operator, as with projection
instruments, sees a spot that can be moved anywhere in the overlap and up or
down to touch the model surface. A mechanical or electronic system moves
a pencil into the corresponding position on a plotting table to which the map
manuscript is fixed.
With computerized analytic instruments the mechanical operation is
limited to measuring coordinates on the two photographs, and the conversion
to a three-dimensional model is performed entirely by the computer. It is
possible with the most precise plotting instruments of either type to draw
a map at four to six times the scale of the photographs and to plot contours
accurately at a vertical interval of about one one-thousandth of the height
from which the photographs were taken. With such analytic instruments the
record can be stored in digital as well as graphic form to be plotted later at
any convenient scale.
All these methods produce a line or drawn map; some of them also create
a data file on disk or tape, containing the coordinates of all the lines and other
features on the map. On the other hand, aerial photographs can be combined
and printed directly to form a photomap. For flat areas this operation requires
simply cutting and pasting the photographs together into a mosaic. For greater
accuracy the centres of the photographs may be aligned by the use of slotted
templates to produce a photomap called a controlled mosaic.
A much more precise technique is based on the use of an orthophotoscope.
With this device, overlapping photographs are employed just as in the
stereoscopic plotter, but the instrument, rather than the manual tracing of the
features and contours, scans the overlap and produces an orthophotograph
by dividing the area into small sections, each of which is correctly scaled.
This procedure is best applied to areas of low relief without tall buildings;
the resulting maps can then be substituted for line maps in rural areas where
they are practically useful in planning resettlement in agricultural projects.
Because no fair drawing is required, the final printed map can be produced
much more quickly and cheaply than would otherwise be possible.

Surveying of underwater features, or hydrographic surveying, formerly
required techniques very different from ground surveying, for two reasons: the
surveyor ordinarily was moving instead of stationary, and the surface being
mapped could not be seen. The first problem, making it difficult to establish a
framework except near land or in shoal areas, was dealt with by dead reckoning
between points established by astronomical fixes. In effect a traverse would
be run with the ship’s bearing measured by compass and distances obtained
either by measuring speed and time or by a modern log that directly records
distances. These have to be checked frequently, because however accurate
the log or airspeed indicator and compass, the track of a ship or aircraft is not
the same as its course. Crosscurrents or winds continually drive the craft off
course, and those along the course affect the speed and the distance run over
the ground beneath.
The only way a hydrographer could chart the seabed before underwater
echo sounding and television became available was to cast overboard at
intervals a sounding line with a lead weight at the end and measure the
length of the line paid out when the weight hit the bottom. The line was
marked in fathoms, that is, units of one one-thousandth of a nautical mile, or
approximately six feet (1,8 metres).
Sounding by lead is obviously very slow, especially in deep waters, and
the introduction of echo sounding in the early 20th century marked a great
improvement. It was made possible by the invention of electronic devices for
the measurement of short intervals of time. Echo sounding depends on timing
the lapse between the transmission of a short loud noise or pulse and its return
from the target – in this case the bottom of the sea or lake. Sound travels
about 5,000 feet (1.500 metres) per second in water, so that an accuracy of a
few milliseconds in measurements of the time intervals gives depths within
a few feet.
The temperature and density of water affect the speed at which sound
waves travel through it, and allowances have to be made for variations in
these properties. The reflected signals are recorded several times a second on
a moving strip of paper, showing to scale the depth beneath the ship’s track.
The echoes may also show other objects, such as schools of fish, or they may
reveal the dual nature of the bottom, where a layer of soft mud may overlie
rock. Originally only the depth that was directly beneath the ship was measured,
leaving gaps between the ship’s tracks. Later inventions, which include
sideways-directed sonar and television cameras, have made it possible to fill
these gaps. While measurements of depths away from the ship’s track are not
so accurate, the pictures reveal any dangerous objects such as rock pinnacles
or wrecks, and the survey vessel can then be diverted to survey them in detail.
Modern position-fixing techniques using radar have made the whole
process much simpler, for the ship’s location is now known continuously
with reference to fixed stations on shore or satellite tracks. Another modern
technique is the use of pictures taken from aircraft or satellites to indicate the
presence and shape of shoal areas and to aid the planning of their detailed
survey.
An alternative to the use of radar or satellite signals for continuous and
automatic recording of a ship’s position is the employment of inertial guidance
systems. These devices, developed to satisfy military requirements, detect
every acceleration involved in the motion of a craft from its known starting

distance and direction traveled.
For studying the seabed in detail, the bottom of the sounding lead was
hollowed to hold a charge of grease to pick up a sample from the sea floor.
Today television cameras can be lowered to transmit pictures back to the survey

the water, which often is murky. Ordinary cameras also are used in pairs for
making stereoscopic pictures of underwater structures such as drilling rigs or
the wreckage of ancient ships.
